I upload the new version of the neural network structre lib and dll file(NEW VERSION 2020 folder)
you can download the folder and create your own neural network.
The newversion offer the float data type.
I wrote how to use the algorithm on Read me.txt 
The next version will be released with the reinforcement algorithm.

<July 26, 2020>
Don't actually use the OLD folder files I found totally wrong equations in backpropagation.
But if you want you can reference the matrix algorithm; they are working perfectly.
I fixed equations, made a whole new algorithm for neural networks with new methods.
Additionally making the codes in block-like TensorFlow Keras.
I will upload these new codes after I finished to make a reinforcement algorithm.
If you want you can see the new version flow chart in https://sites.google.com/view/gesope/project/neural-network-in-c/flow-chart?authuser=0
