Don't actually use the OLD folder files I found totally wrong equations in backpropagation.
But if you want you can reference the matrix algorithm; they are working perfectly.
I fixed equations, made a whole new algorithm for neural networks with new methods.
Additionally making the codes in block-like TensorFlow Keras.
I will upload these new codes after I finished to make a reinforcement algorithm.
