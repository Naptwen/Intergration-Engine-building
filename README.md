I upload the new version of the neural network structre lib and dll file.
you can download the folder and create your own neural network.

<July 26, 2020>
Don't actually use the OLD folder files I found totally wrong equations in backpropagation.
But if you want you can reference the matrix algorithm; they are working perfectly.
I fixed equations, made a whole new algorithm for neural networks with new methods.
Additionally making the codes in block-like TensorFlow Keras.
I will upload these new codes after I finished to make a reinforcement algorithm.
If you want you can see the new version flow chart in https://sites.google.com/view/gesope/project/neural-network-in-c/flow-chart?authuser=0
